  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The player is the Doom Slayer or Doomguy who awakens on a Mars UAC (Union Aerospace Corporation) base in 2149 which is run by a cyborg named Dr. Samuel Hayden.</p>
  <p>Samuel Hayden and the UAC manufacture Argent energy which is a filtered product of the literal Energy from Hell to prevent the Earth's energy crisis.</p>
  <p>After Olivia Pierce, a scientist who successfully facilitated a demonic invasion on Mars, The Doom Slayer has one sole objective, to kill every last demon and stop the invasion.</p>

  <h2>The Slayer's Fight</h2>
  <p>As you wake up from a long coma, you immediately find 3 demons in your room. This is no problem as you tear their skulls and rip the demons' bodies in half.</p>
  <p>The Doom Slayer manages to find his way to a Praetor suit which gives him all kinds of unique abilities and added strength as if he needed it. The suit also allowed him to breathe on Mars.</p>
  <p>Soon enough, he finds a combat shotgun which he uses to shoot some of the Common Foot Soldiers such as the possessed and imp troops.</p>
  <p>Armed with his expertise, weapons and raw strength, the Doom Slayer fights his way through a demonic-infested facility in hopes of destroying the very thing the demons were summoned by, Argent Energy.</p>
  <p>Samuel Hayden doesn't appreciate this but does help Doomguy achieve his goal of closing the Hell portal and stopping the invasion for good.</p>
  <p>Samuel gives the Praetor suit a little upgrade / Jarvis-like assistant called VEGA who informs the Slayer of his mission, quests, and the history of the attack.</p>
  <p>VEGA had to be destroyed to create a portal to Hell but the Slayer secretly kept a copy of him inside the Praetor suit.</p>
  <p>The Slayer is then sent to Hell where he is to retrieve certain artifacts to control the demonic invasion, one being the Crucible.</p>
  <p>Before doing so, The Slayer acquires the BFG-9000, a gun capable of exponential damage but the Slayer must defeat a mutated beast the size of a small house.</p>
  <p>The Doom Slayer defeats the Cyberdemon with ease and moves on with his quest to retrieve the Crucible.</p>
  <p>He finds the location but must defeat not one, not two, but Three Hell Guards, each with abilities capable of killing Barons of Hell with ease. This is no problem for the Slayer as he rips their heart out of their chest and tears it to shreds before retrieving the Crucible.</p>

  <hr>
  <h2>Final Fight</h2>
  <p>Before returning back to Mars, the Slayer must face the one who created this mess, Olivia Pierce who transforms into a Spider Mastermind equipped with lasers, electrical powers and a spider body the size of 2 football fields.</p>
  <p>The Slayer defeats her without a scratch to prove it and returns to Mars.</p>

  <hr>
  <h2>Betrayal</h2>
  <p>In a turn of events, Samuel Hayden traps the Slayer and steals the Crucible. Samuel thanks the Slayer for his efforts in successfully closing the portal but must use the Crucible to fix the energy crisis back on Earth.</p>

  <hr>
  <h2>Aftermath</h2>
  <p>Samuel Hayden then sends the Slayer back to Hell where he continues his eternal battle against the demons of Hell.</p>
